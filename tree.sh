## Recursive file/dirsize checking script, by Patsie
##
## This script builds a list of files/directories and their size (du -akx)
## and processes this list to a human readable tree shape
## The 'du -akx' is only as good as the permissions the owner has.
## So preferably run as root* to get the best results, or use only on
## directories for which you have read permissions. Anything you can't
## read is not in the list.

#* ABS Guide author advises caution when running scripts as root!
