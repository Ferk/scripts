# Simple Alarm
####

# It starts xmms2 playing the playlist "wakeup" at a given time

# I use cron to set up the time(s) when the script will be triggered.
# you can also use the "at" command to set temporal alarms.

# To set off the alarm you will have to type "alarm off" in your terminal
# the typing should make your brain react and wake you up... in theory :P
