** Description of the scripts

*** alarm
A simple alarm script to wake you up

*** autoscroll.sh 
Slowly scrolls down with the mouse automatically, so you can read a webpage,
a book, or whatever you want to read on your PC.
Useful when you have your hands busy when eating or doing something.

You can activate/deactivate it by binding a key shortcut to..
:    pkill autoscroll.sh || autoscroll.sh

You need xmacro installed.

*** turboclick.sh
Performs a lot of clicks pretty fast in an endless loop. It can drive you crazy
if you execute it unprepared. I just made it for fun, and beating those silly flash
games about "how fast can you click?"

You can activate/deactivate it by binding a key shortcut to..
:    pkill turboclick.sh || turboclick.sh

You need xmacro installed.
